\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em \-: The \hyperlink{readLine_8h_ae5fe12dcd80500477715cce8c11a29b5}{read\-Line()} function reads bytes from the file referred to by the file descriptor argument fd until a newline is encountered. The input byte sequence is returned in the location pointed to by buffer, which must point to a region of at least n bytes of memory. The returned string is always null-\/terminated; thus, at most (n – 1) bytes of actual data will be returned. On success, \hyperlink{readLine_8h_ae5fe12dcd80500477715cce8c11a29b5}{read\-Line()} returns the number of bytes of data placed in buffer; the terminating null byte is not included in this count. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
