Server Design
------------------------
1. Iterative: Server handles one client at  a time, processing that client's request completly, before roceceeding to
	      the next client.

2. Cocurent: The server is designed to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

---------------------------
Note:
	1. Iterative servers are usally suitable only when client requests can be handled quickly, since each client must wait until all the preceding clients have been serviced.
